Four-Color-Map
==============

A NetBeans project.

Map coloring using four colors, using a KML file as input. The "Census, State Government Tax Collections, USA, 2007.kml" is the provided map input, obtained from [geocommons](http://geocommons.com/users/data/).

No attempt is made at implementing a map coloring algorithm. Instead, the user can select a state and one of four colors. Based on this selection, the program will alert the user if any neighboring states share the same color. In this way, a map can be colored.
